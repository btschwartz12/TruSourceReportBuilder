1. finish conflict handling for rest of filter types ( even if some are blank should account)
    - check blanks real quick, test

2. have collectionview and everything use the Filterable protocol instead of filter so that bundles will work
    MAKE BUNDLES UNEDITABLE but still be able to see description

3. have to add include as a direction, just reverse in the closure and make sue the description makes sense

4. allow emply filter bodies if is actually possible in the report

figure out what phone type is

	3)	 - once done, clean up all modified controllers ( begin with filter controller)
	4)	- input next
