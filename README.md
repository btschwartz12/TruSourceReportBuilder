# TruSourceReportBuilder

### By: Ben Schwartz

TruSourceReportBuilder is a macOS app that was developed during my senior high school project for an insurance company. The app is designed to analyze Google Sheets databases to build a report of the data. 

Although the app has some basic functionality, it is not complete and may require additional work to become fully functional. This project was completed some time ago and may need updates to the code to function properly. 

This repository contains the main branch which is the latest version of the code. To use TruSourceReportBuilder, please clone the repository and run the app in Xcode. Since this project is incomplete, we cannot guarantee full functionality or support.
